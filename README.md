<h1>To-Do List</h1>
<br />
This is the first project I have created from the Rocketseat ReactJS course. It is just a simple to-do list, which uses basic features from React(CSS modules, useState, e.t.c.)
Please do not mind the portuguese in the page, as that was the language in template for the project.
<br />
<h2>Notes</h2>
<li>This page comes with two predefined tasks to show the pages functionality.</li>
<li>Anything added or deleted will only stay there during the session. Since this was a small project made to test my understanding of what I've already done, the requirements didn't care enough about storing permanent data.</li>
<li>If the page has broken functionality, or it just sucks, do an issue request plz :))))))))))))).</li>
