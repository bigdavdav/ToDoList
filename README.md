<h1>To-Do List</h1>
<Br />
This is the first project I have created from the Rocketseat ReactJS course. It is just a simple to-do list, which uses basic features from React(CSS modules, useState, e.t.c.)
Do not mind the porguguese, as that was the language in template for the project.

If the page has broken functionality, or it just sucks, do an issue request plz :))))))))))))).
